So that you can shootIn order to land on the wireless charging pad through the sliding roof dome opened under control by the control unit after takeoff, the drone photographs a 3D image through the 3D image sensor and status information including the captured 3D image Is repeatedly transmitted to the regional control center and repeatedly adjusts the position of the drone through control information received from the regional control center,The control unit supplies wireless power to the drone through the wireless charging pad upon receipt of charging request control information from the regional control center after landing of the drone to the wireless charging pad using the 3D image,The control information received from the regional control center according to the state information including the 3D image uses a 3D map to specify a 3D position of the drone corresponding to the captured 3D image of the state information and to specify the specified 3D It includes information for adjusting the current position of the drone to move from the position to the 3D position of the wireless charging pad,A forest fire event is detected by the regional control center from an external image photographed by the drone,Forest fire monitoring device.\n\n 2. delete.\n\n 3. According to claim 1,The sliding roof dome is provided with a solar panel,The forest fire monitoring device,Further comprising a battery that stores the power generated through the solar panel and supplies power to the wireless charging pad and the control unit;Forest fire monitoring device.\n\n 4. According to claim 3,A pillar fixed to a designated location in the forest to support the sliding roof dome, the drone and the wireless charging pad, and having a specified height; AndFurther comprising a wireless AP for transmitting and receiving wireless packets through wireless communication,The drone tracks a fire occurrence event by moving to a designated location of control information received through a wireless packet,Forest fire monitoring device.\n\n 5. As a forest fire monitoring system using drones,A plurality of forest fire monitoring device according to claim 1; AndIncluding; a regional control center that monitors the occurrence of forest fires from the images taken by the plurality of forest fire monitoring devices and controls the drones of the forest fire monitoring devices to track forest fires;Forest fire monitoring system.\n\n 6. The method of claim 5,The regional control center receives an image photographed by a drone of the forest fire monitoring device, determines a fire occurrence event from the received image, identifies a location where the fire has occurred through the provided 3D map, and determines the location specified by the forest fire monitoring device. Transmitting control information,The forest fire monitoring device opens the provided sliding roof dome upon receiving control information,The drone of the forest fire monitoring device moves to a location specified in the control information,Forest fire monitoring system.\n\n 7. The method of claim 6,After moving to the specified three-dimensional position, the drone takes an image using the equipped camera, transmits the captured image and the measured location information using the equipped GPS sensor to the regional control center, and the equipped camera Automatically tracking the direction of the forest fire generated through the image from,Forest fire monitoring system.\n\n 8. The method of claim 7,The drone estimates a moving direction of a forest fire by recognizing a change in color temperature corresponding to pixel data in an image area from an equipped visual camera and moves in the estimated moving direction to continuously shoot an image through the visual camera,The drone estimates the direction of the forest fire by recognizing the change in temperature data for each pixel in the area of the thermal image from the provided thermal image camera and moves in the estimated direction of travel to continuously shoot the thermal image through the thermal image camera doing,Forest fire monitoring system.\n\n 9. The method of claim 7,The drone further transmits the measured battery level information to the regional control center,The regional control center determines the closest forest fire monitoring device among one or more wildfire monitoring devices without drones when the battery level of the battery remaining information is less than a specified threshold, and controls the battery remaining amount of control information requesting movement to the determined forest fire monitoring device. Transmitting to a drone below this threshold and transmitting control information to open the sliding roof dome to the control unit of the forest fire monitoring device when the drone arrives at the determined forest fire monitoring device according to the location information received from the drone,Forest fire monitoring system.\n\n 10. delete ."
